Assignment 3

first we will check weather the service is accessible within cluster
     if yes - then we have to check IP and port no is correct or not
     if no - then we have to check it is working in container correctly or not
     Also we have to check yaml file contents weather NodeSelector and port no is correct or not
may be kube-proxy is not working properly.
